const prompt = require("prompt-sync")();: 

This line imports the prompt-sync library and creates a prompt function. The prompt-sync library allows you to get user input in a synchronous manner, meaning the program will wait for user input before proceeding. The () at the end of require("prompt-sync")() is used to immediately invoke the function returned by require("prompt-sync").
